With this implemntation you a VM can be converted into a VM template without the need of running 2 post processors - 
it can be done by a single configuration option convert_to_template.

But on the other hand your vSphere installation must be quite up-to-date with at least version 6.5. Builds on lower 
vesions may work, but due to some configuration options errors may come up because of the older vSphere API.

In this example we are using again a dedicated host assignment because we are not using DRS on this test system. 
If your are using DRS on your vSphere cluster you can replace the host parameter with resource_pool. The set of 
vsphere connection parameters is well documented. in packer.io
